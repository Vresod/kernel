Yes. This a real thing.
I'm sorry if you thought this was a joke: it isn't.

# What language?
It is written in x86 assembly language for the 8086 microprocessor.

# How do I use it?
Either have a 8086 microprocessor and install windoge on it.
or do this:
1. Have free space (obvious).
2. Download emu8086 to emulate the microprocessor.
3. Open `kernel.asm` inside of emu8086.
4. Press `RUN`. Voila! Windoge is succssefully running inside
of an 8086 microprocessor.
